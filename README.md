# Movie Similarity with NLP

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to find similarities between movies based on their plot summaries from Wikipedia and IMDb. The project includes a cluster algorithm to show similarities as well as a dendrogram to visualize them.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- `nltk`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`


## Data

The data for this project comes from Wikipedia and IMDb. The plot summaries for each movie were extracted using web scraping techniques.

## Results

The results of this project show that movies with similar plot summaries are clustered together. The dendrogram provides a visual representation of these clusters.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how NLP techniques can be used to find similarities between movies based on their plot summaries. The use of a cluster algorithm and dendrogram provides a powerful tool for visualizing these similarities.
